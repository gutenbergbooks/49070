<h1>Nuclear Clocks</h1>
<p><b>The Understanding the Atom Series</b></p>
<p>Nuclear Energy is playing a vital role in the life of every
man, woman, and child in the United States today. In the
years ahead it will affect increasingly all the peoples of the
earth. It is essential that all Americans gain an understanding
of this vital force if they are to discharge thoughtfully their
responsibilities as citizens and if they are to realize fully the
myriad benefits that nuclear energy offers them.</p>
<p>The United States Atomic Energy Commission provides
this booklet to help you achieve such understanding.</p>

<h2 id="c1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><i>How old is a rock?</i></p>
<p><i>How old is man?</i></p>
<p><i>How old is the earth?</i></p>
<p>It would be difficult to find a reason why anyone would
really have to know the answers to these questions, yet
they have been asked over and over again since the dawn of
human society. The records of every civilization disclose
attempts to delve into the past beyond the memory of the
oldest man, beyond recorded history, beyond earliest
legend.</p>
<p>Curiosity about the remote past may be very ancient, but
the only reliable method of measuring very long intervals
of time is new. The possibility of doing so became apparent
only after the discovery of <a class="gloss" href="#Radioactivity">RADIOACTIVITY</a><a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> in 1896 by
Henri Becquerel, when Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898
recognized that some atoms are radioactive and change by
themselves into other atoms at regular and constant rates.
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
If something gradually transforms itself into something
else, if this transformation goes on at a known pace, and if
all the products of the activity are preserved in some kind
of a <a class="gloss" href="#ClosedSystem">CLOSED SYSTEM</a>, then it is theoretically possible to
calculate the time that has elapsed since the process
started. The theory was clear for years; the only problem
was how to satisfy all those ifs.</p>
<p>By 1910 it was well established that the earth must be
extremely ancient. Analyses of some minerals containing
uranium showed them to be hundreds of millions of years
old, even though the uranium came from rocks that were
known to be relatively young among geologic <a class="gloss" href="#Strata">STRATA</a>.
Measurements still were inaccurate, however, and only a
few rare and unusually rich radioactive minerals contained
enough of the products of <a class="gloss" href="#RadioactiveDecay">RADIOACTIVE DECAY</a><a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> to allow
analysis of their age by the crude methods then available.</p>
<p>Not much progress was made for about 30 years until
A. O. C. Nier, a Harvard University physicist, perfected an
instrument called a <a class="gloss" href="#MassSpectrometer">MASS SPECTROMETER</a> (to be described
later) just before World War II. The rapid technological
advances of the war years followed. The Manhattan
Project<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> made the atomic bombs that ended the
fighting; it also developed new scientific techniques that
could be applied, when peace returned, to the measurement
of geologic time.</p>
<p>The next important advance was contributed in 1946 by
Arthur Holmes in England and by F. G. Houtermans in
Germany. Each of these scientists had seen Nier&rsquo;s reports
before the war and had realized that Nier&rsquo;s mass-spectrometer
analyses of lead made it possible, for the
first time, to make rational calculations about the age of
the earth. The two scientists independently calculated that
age at about 2 to 3 billion years, using the handful of data
available to them from Nier&rsquo;s measurements. It is interesting
that today, thousands of analyses later, our
planet&rsquo;s age usually is given as 4.5 billion years. The
early estimates were not far off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Development of various methods for measuring the age
of minerals followed rapidly, and by 1955 many fundamental
studies needed for measuring the age of very old
substances were complete. The basic techniques are summarized
in Table I. They will be explained later. The new
methods produced broad confirmation of the early rough
estimates and they also brought a few surprises.</p>
<p>Before we go into these discoveries, let us look at some
theoretical foundations.</p>

<h2 id="c2">THEORY OF NUCLEAR AGE DETERMINATION</h2>
<p>We can think of the nucleus of an atom as a sort of
drop&mdash;a bunch of <a class="gloss" href="#Neutrons">NEUTRONS</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#Protons">PROTONS</a> held together
by very strong short-range forces. These elementary particles
within a nucleus are not arranged in any fixed or
rigid array, but are free to move about within the grip of
these forces. These motions may be quite violent, but for
most <a class="gloss" href="#Nuclide">NUCLIDES</a> found in nature, the nuclear forces are
powerful enough to keep everything confined; thus the
nuclei of these atoms hold together, and are said to be
stable. If any one nucleus of a given <a class="gloss" href="#Isotopes">ISOTOPE</a> is stable,
then all others are also stable, because what is true for
one atom of a given kind is true for all others of the same
kind.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Some nuclides, both man-made and natural, are unstable,
however. Their nuclei are in such violent turmoil that the
nuclear forces cannot always hold them together, and
various bits and pieces fly off. If we were to try to predict
when one particular unstable nucleus would thus disintegrate,
however, we could not succeed, because the instant
any specific decay (or disintegration) event will occur is a
matter of chance. Only if a large number of unstable nuclei
of one kind are collected together can we say with certainty
that, out of that number, a certain proportion will decay in
a given time. It turns out that this proportion is the same
regardless of any external conditions.</p>
<p>This property of nuclei to decay by themselves is called
radioactivity. Radioactive nuclei decay at constant rates
regardless of temperature, pressure, chemical combination,
or physical state. The process goes on no matter
what happens to the atom. In other words, the activity inside
the nucleus is in no way affected by what happens to
the <a class="gloss" href="#Electrons">ELECTRONS</a> circling around it. (Only in very special
cases can outside disturbances affect the radioactivity of a
nucleus and then only slightly. For all practical purposes,
rates of radioactive decay are constant.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Most radioactive nuclides have rapid rates of decay
(and lose their radioactivity in a few days, or a few years,
at most); most of these are known today only because they
are produced artificially. Some of them may have been
present at the time the solar system was formed, but they
have since decayed to such insignificant fractions of their
original amounts that they can no longer be detected. Only
a few radioactive nuclides decay slowly enough to have
been preserved to this day, and so are present in nature.
They are listed in Table II.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>In a large number of radioactive nuclei of a given kind, a
certain fraction will decay in a specific length of time.
Let&rsquo;s take this fraction as one-half and measure the time
it takes for half the nuclei to decay. This time it is called
the <a class="gloss" href="#HalfLife">HALF-LIFE</a> of that particular nucleus and there are
various accurate physical ways of measuring it. During the
interval of one half-life, one-half of the nuclei will decay,
during the next half-life half of what&rsquo;s left will decay, and
so on. We may tabulate it like this:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><th>Elapsed time (Number of half-lives) </th><th class="c">Amount left of what was originally present</th></tr>
<tr><td class="c">1 </td><td class="c">&frac12;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c">2 </td><td class="c">&frac14;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c">3 </td><td class="c">&#8539;</td></tr>

<tr><td class="c">7 </td><td class="c">&sup1;/&#8321;&#8322;&#8328;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c">... </td><td class="c">...</td></tr>
</table>
<p>In other words, after seven half-lives, less than 1% of
the original amount of material will still be radioactive and
the remaining 99%+ of its atoms will have been converted
to atoms of another nuclide. This kind of process can be
made the basis of a clock. It works, in effect, like the
upper chamber of an hourglass. Mathematically it is
written:</p>
<p class="center">N = N&#8320;e<sup>-&lambda;t</sup></p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>where</dt>
<dd>N = the number of radioactive atoms present in the system now,</dd>
<dd>N&#8320; = the number that was present when t = 0, (in other words, at the time the clock started),</dd>
<dd>e = the base of natural (or Napierian<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a>) logarithms (the numerical value of e = 2.718 ...),</dd>
<dd>&lambda; (lambda) = the decay rate of the radioactive material, expressed in atoms decaying per atom per unit of time,</dd>
<dd>t = the time that has elapsed since the origin of system, expressed in the same units.</dd></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Obviously, in ordinary computations that would not be
enough information to calculate the time, because there
still are two unknowns, <i>N&#8320;</i> and <i>t</i>. In a closed system,
however, the atoms that have decayed do not disappear
into thin air. They merely change into other atoms, called
daughter atoms, and remain in the system.</p>
<p>And at any point in time, there will be both <a class="gloss" href="#Parent">PARENT</a> and
<a class="gloss" href="#Daughter">DAUGHTER</a> atoms mixed together in the material. The
older the material, the more daughters and the fewer
parents. Some daughters are also radioactive, but this
does not change the basic situation. Thus it follows that</p>
<p class="center">N&#8320; = N + D</p>
<p>where D = the number of daughter (decayed) atoms. We
may then substitute into the first equation</p>
<p class="center">N = (N + D) e<sup>-&lambda;t</sup></p>
<p>and solve</p>
<p class="center">t = 1/&lambda; &middot; ln(1 + D/N)</p>
<p>where ln = the natural logarithm, the logarithm to base e.</p>
<p>This kind of system can be represented crudely by an
old-fashioned hourglass, as shown in the figure, which has
the parameters of these equations marked. (Keep in mind,
however, that this is only a gross analogy. Nuclear clocks
run at logarithmically decreasing rates, but the speed of a
good hourglass is roughly constant.)</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_6">
<img src="images/pgg005.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="372" />
<p class="caption small"><i>An hourglass illustrates an ideal closed system. Nothing is added and nothing is removed&mdash;the sand just runs from the top bulb to the bottom.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Remember that the decaying nucleus does not disappear.
It changes into another nucleus, and this new nucleus forms
an atom that may be captured and held fixed by natural
processes. The decayed nuclei are thus collected, so that
here we have the bottom chamber of the hourglass.</p>
<p>But sometimes we need only the top chamber of an hourglass.</p>
<h2 id="c3">THE CARBON-14 CLOCK</h2>
<p>Carbon-14 decay is the best example of a top-only hourglass.
Carbon-14 is constantly being produced in the upper
atmosphere from atoms of nitrogen-14 being struck by
neutrons that had their origin in <a class="gloss" href="#CosmicRays">COSMIC RAYS</a>. The reaction
is written:</p>
<p class="center">&sup1;&#8308;N + neutron &rarr; &sup1;&#8308;C + proton</p>
<p>Radioactive decay then follows, with a half-life of 5800
years<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> for the &sup1;&#8308;C.</p>
<p class="center">&sup1;&#8308;C &rarr; &sup1;&#8308;N + electron (<a class="gloss" href="#BetaParticle">BETA PARTICLE</a>)</p>
<p>The radiocarbon emits an electron and changes back into
nitrogen.</p>
<p>As far as anyone can tell, &sup1;&#8308;C was produced at a constant
rate above the earth for at least 50,000 years before the
first atomic bomb was exploded. In other words, the &sup1;&#8308;C
cycle is like an hourglass in which the sand in the upper
part is replenished as fast as it runs out through the hole
in the waist. A process of this sort, where production
equals decay, is called a <a class="gloss" href="#SecularEquilibrium">SECULAR EQUILIBRIUM</a>.</p>
<p>The newly produced &sup1;&#8308;C soon is evenly mixed with the
carbon dioxide in the air, is taken up by all living plants,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
and then finds its way into all living animals. In effect, all
carbon in living organisms contains a constant proportion
of &sup1;&#8308;C. If any of this carbon is taken out of circulation&mdash;when
a tree branch is broken off, for instance, or when a
shellfish dies in the ocean&mdash;no more new &sup1;&#8308;C is added to
that particular system, but the old &sup1;&#8308;C continues to run out.
In effect it now starts measuring time as an hourglass
should.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_7">
<img src="images/pgg006.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" />
<p class="caption small"><i>To illustrate secular equilibrium, one must imagine an hourglass in which the sand in the top bulb is continuously replenished&mdash;as fast as it runs out through the hole in the waist and disappears.</i></p>
</div>
<p>When we find a piece of charcoal in a cave or a piece of
wood in some ancient structure, for example, we can measure
the amount of carbon in it, determine how much of it
is &sup1;&#8308;C, and then calculate back to the time when the radioactivity
from the &sup1;&#8308;C was the same as we now find in living
wood. In other words, if we assume that we know from the
observed secular equilibrium how much &sup1;&#8308;C originally was
present in living material, then we can calculate the time
of death of any similar but ancient material. That is the
basis of the &sup1;&#8308;C method of age determination.</p>

accurately within the margin of a few hundred
years. This fixes the time at which the wood for the rafter

hence the period in which the men lived who used the wood.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c4">Carbon-14 Counting</h3>
<p>Carbon-14 measurements are made by taking a known
amount of carbon, reducing it to a gas, and then counting
the &sup1;&#8308;C disintegrations in the gas. This may sound simple,
but in reality the measurement process is a formidable
undertaking, because the amount of the &sup1;&#8308;C isotope in the
carbon is so extremely small. (The remainder of the
carbon, of course, consists of other isotopes&mdash;&sup1;&sup2;C or &sup1;&sup3;C,
which are stable.)</p>
<p>There are two basic techniques. The carbon can be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Burned with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, or</p>
<p>2. Reduced chemically to methane or ethane, or to a
carbide from which acetylene can be evolved by adding
water. (See booklet cover and description on <a href="#Page_59">page 59</a>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first technique is the simpler, but carbon dioxide
(CO&#8322;) contains only one atom of carbon per molecule,
whereas acetylene (C&#8322;H&#8322;) and ethane (C&#8322;H&#8326;) each contain
two. Consequently, the <a class="gloss" href="#SpecificActivity">SPECIFIC ACTIVITY</a> of acetylene or
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
ethane is twice that of carbon dioxide, other things being
equal. For that reason acetylene or ethane are the preferred
gases in some laboratories. On the other hand, they
are explosive, and that cautions other scientists into using
the carbon dioxide method.</p>
<p>Whichever gas is used, it is first purified and then stored
in a bottle for a month or so. This storage allows for decay
(disappearance) of any radon, the gaseous radioactive
product of uranium decay. Uranium contamination is difficult
to avoid at the low radioactivity levels of &sup1;&#8308;C, but the
half-life of radon is only 3.82 days, so that it will decay to
an insignificant level in a month. After the storage period,
the gas is pumped into an array of instruments known as a
low-background <a class="gloss" href="#ProportionalCounter">PROPORTIONAL COUNTER</a>, and its radioactivity
is determined. This is an involved process.
First there is the matter of the <a class="gloss" href="#BackgroundCount">BACKGROUND COUNT</a>.</p>
<p>The background count of an instrument is the number of
pulses (counts) it will give per unit time when there is <i>no</i>
radioactive sample in it. These counts are caused by
cosmic rays, by radioactive contamination always found in
the vicinity of the counter, or by any contamination inside
the instrument. In &sup1;&#8308;C counting, all these sources of background
must be reduced to negligible levels. This is done
in a number of ways.</p>
<p>For one thing, the whole assembly is constructed with
surrounding walls of lead or iron more than a foot thick.
Such a shield will stop all the <a class="gloss" href="#GammaRays">GAMMA RAYS</a> coming from
radioactive contamination in the laboratory and much of the
cosmic radiation; high-energy cosmic rays and all neutrons
still will get through. Therefore, there is an <a class="gloss" href="#AnticoincidenceRing">ANTICOINCIDENCE RING</a>
inside the lead shield. This is a cylindrical
space completely surrounded by <a class="gloss" href="#GeigerCounters">GEIGER COUNTERS</a>
that are connected to each other and to the <a class="gloss" href="#SampleCounter">SAMPLE COUNTER</a>
in the middle. With this arrangement, when the
sample counter and any ring counter discharge simultaneously,
it is a signal that the pulse triggering this response
was caused by some energetic particles, such as a
cosmic ray, passing through the whole assembly. A pulse
recorded simultaneously on two counters is automatically
rejected from the counting mechanisms. Some instruments
have been designed with a cylinder of paraffin immediately
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
inside the anticoincidence ring, to slow down neutrons so
that they can be captured, and with a final shield of highly
purified mercury between two cylinders of selected steel
to hold out even more unwanted radiation.</p>

<p class="caption small"><i>A carbon-14 counter. Sketch (above) shows arrangement of components in photo (left).</i></p>
</div>
<p>Finally, the sample counters are made of specially
selected metal tubing that is extremely low in radioactive
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
content, with a fine wire stretched down the middle. (In
some recent designs, the anticoincidence ring and sample
counter are combined in a single cylindrical housing with a
thin foil of metallized plastic between them.) A thin glass
filling tube connects the sample counter with the outside
world.</p>

</div>
<p>The radiocarbon-bearing gas is pumped into the sample
counter through the filling tube, and all the counts resulting
from its disintegrations are recorded electronically. The
age of the sample is calculated from the <a class="gloss" href="#NetCountingRate">NET COUNTING RATE</a>
(the sample counting rate minus the background); the
lower the counting rate the higher the age. The upper limit

<p>Carbon-14 is by far the most widely used method of
measuring geologic time. It has become the mainstay of
archeology and geology for studies of events of the past
50,000 years or so, and also has wide applications in
climatology, ecology, and geography. It would be difficult
to pick out the most significant example of the use of this
method, but one important contribution has been in study of
the early inhabitants of North America. With the aid of &sup1;&#8308;C
it has been possible to date human living sites from many
points in the western United States. The first appearance of
these sites, about 11,500 years ago, apparently coincided
with the time when a land bridge was open from Asia to
America over what is now the Bering Strait. An ice-free
passage extended from this bridge through present-day
Alaska and western Canada to the United States. This may
have been the route taken by the first immigrants to
America&mdash;a population of mammoth-hunters, who made
the characteristic flint <i>Clovis</i> arrow and spear points.</p>

</div>
<p>By about 11,000 years ago, these Clovis people had
spread across the area of the United States and into
Mexico. It may have been they who killed off the mammoths
and then gradually assumed the characteristics of the
<i>Folsom</i> culture. The Folsom people were bison-hunters,
and long were thought to have been the first population in
America. It was with the use of &sup1;&#8308;C that it finally was possible
to place these two cultures in proper sequence&mdash;the
Clovis first&mdash;and to correlate them with major natural
changes, especially the advance and retreat of glaciers
across the continent.</p>

<p>It is apparent that Table II on <a href="#Page_6">page 6</a>, showing the
long-lived radioactive nuclides, is much longer than the
list of the seven shown here that are actually useful in
practice. Some of the nuclides that are theoretically
available are useless on a practical basis, because they
are so rare in nature. Many others cannot be used for
reasons that are fundamental to the whole process of
nuclear age determination by &ldquo;whole hourglass&rdquo; (that is,
parent-daughter) methods. Let&rsquo;s look at these reasons.</p>
<p>These methods are based on closed systems in which the
daughter products of the radioactive decay are locked with
the parent material from the beginning of the system, and
nothing is added or removed thereafter. To state it in
terms of our analogy, the hourglass must be in perfect
working order&mdash;no leaks or cracks permitted.</p>
<p>There is another fundamental requirement: At the beginning,
the bottom part of the hourglass must be empty.
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
If some sand were already in the bottom at the start, we
would mistakenly be led to conclude that the time elapsed
was longer than it actually was. That necessity places a
severe limitation on the type of system we can use.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the decay of potassium-40 into
calcium-40. Measuring this process is perfectly suitable
from the point of view of half-life, but the daughter product
is identical with the most common isotope of ordinary
calcium. And calcium is present everywhere in nature!
Even the purest mineral of potassium, sylvite (the salt,
potassium chloride), contains so much calcium impurity
that the <a class="gloss" href="#Radiogenic">RADIOGENIC</a> daughter calcium, produced by the
decay of potassium in geologic time, is negligible in
comparison. We can say that the bottom of this potassium-40
hourglass has been stuffed with so much sand from the
very beginning that the few grains that fall through the
waist are lost in the overall mass. This demonstrates that
schemes involving the decay of a relatively rare nuclide
into a relatively common one are not usable. Natural geochemical
separations of elements are never perfect,
anyway.</p>
<p>Similarly, the decay of any of the <a class="gloss" href="#RareEarth">RARE EARTH</a> elements
into other rare earth elements is not particularly helpful,
because the rare earths are so similar chemically they
tend to travel together when they move in nature.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> Wherever
the parent isotope goes, the daughter tags along.</p>
<h3 id="c7">The Rubidium-Strontium Clock</h3>
<p>The decay of rubidium-87 (&#8312;&#8311;Rb) into strontium-87 (&#8312;&#8311;Sr)
is perhaps the most useful scheme for geologic age determination.
The same problem shows up here, but at least
there is a way out of the wilderness. It is not exactly
simple, but a consideration of it is fundamental to understanding
the process of nuclear dating. The figure shows
patterns from mass spectrometer charts; each peak represents
an isotope of strontium, and the height of every peak
is proportional to the relative abundance of that isotope.
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
In the figure, A shows the mass-spectrum of a rock or
mineral containing <a class="gloss" href="#Common">COMMON</a> strontium (which is a mixture
of several isotopes). The peak of &#8312;&#8311;Sr is small compared
to the others. B shows the mass-spectrum of strontium
from an old rubidium-rich mineral <a class="gloss" href="#Crystal">CRYSTAL</a>, drawn
to the same scale, as far as the nonradiogenic isotopes,
&#8312;&#8308;Sr, &#8312;&#8310;Sr, and &#8312;&#8312;Sr, are concerned. The &#8312;&#8311;Sr peak in this
spectrum is obviously larger than in the common strontium
in A. This is because this isotope is radiogenic and has
been accumulating from the decay of rubidium since this
crystal was formed.</p>
<p>The question we must answer is: How much of this &#8312;&#8311;Sr
was formed from &#8312;&#8311;Rb decay and how much originally was
present in the crystal as an impurity? If the amount of this
<a class="gloss" href="#Original">ORIGINAL</a> strontium is not too large, the problem can be
solved by simple arithmetic.</p>
<p>First, we must find a good sample of common strontium&mdash;that
is, ordinary strontium, the kind shown at left in the
figure. We cannot require that this strontium be entirely
uncontaminated by radiogenic strontium, because all strontium
is more or less contaminated. What we need is strontium
contaminated to <i>just the same extent</i> as the strontium
that was taken as an impurity into the closed system when
it first formed. In geological specimens such a material is
usually available.</p>

</div>
<p>Let us take as our closed system a mica crystal in a
mass of granite. Mica contains a fair amount of rubidium,
and it retains its radiogenic strontium very well. Furthermore,
mica crystals are often associated or even intergrown
with the slender, rod-shaped crystals of a mineral
called apatite&mdash;a phosphate of calcium. It is justifiable, on
the basis of geological knowledge, to say that the mica and
the apatite grew at roughly the same time and thus presumably
from the same liquid medium that became granite
when it later solidified. Now strontium is geochemically
similar to calcium, and some strontium will have gone into
the apatite crystal in place of calcium. Apatite contains no
alkalis&mdash;hence apatite will have virtually no rubidium
(which is an alkali) in it to contaminate the &#8312;&#8311;Sr. Consequently,
when we find apatite in an old granite, we know the
apatite will still contain the kind of common strontium that
was taken into the mica crystal when it grew originally.</p>
<p>We can separate the apatite from the granite by standard
mineralogical techniques, extract the strontium from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
apatite chemically, and analyze it on a mass spectrometer
to obtain the isotopic spectrum&mdash;the relative amount of
each isotope that is present. We can then perform the
same isotopic analysis on the strontium extracted from the
mica, and subtract the original (apatite) strontium from
the total (mica) strontium, to obtain the radiogenic component
or daughter product. (See <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a> for details of this
method.)</p>
<p>Obviously, there is a certain error associated with every
isotopic analysis, so such a calculation is meaningful only
when the radiogenic component is large compared with the
error in the measurement of isotopic abundance. When one
large quantity must be subtracted from another large
quantity to obtain a small difference, there is an obvious
limit to how much one can trust the result. The absolute
accuracy in measuring strontium isotope abundance is a
few tenths of 1%, using the best mass spectrometers now
available. In practice, one can trust a calculated age for a
specimen only when the &#8312;&#8311;Sr is as little as about 5% radiogenic.
The results do not mean much when only 1 or 2% is
radiogenic.</p>

<h3 id="c8">The Uranium Fission Clock</h3>
<p>When a neutron strikes the nucleus of uranium-235 (&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;U)
or plutonium-239 (&sup2;&sup3;&#8313;Pu), it may cause the nucleus to split
into two roughly equal fragments, releasing neutrons and
energy. This is the well-known process of neutron-induced
fission, the method in which nuclear energy is produced in
both reactors and bombs.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> The most common uranium
isotope, &sup2;&sup3;&#8312;U, also breaks up by fission, but does so all by
itself, without the need for any external neutrons. That
process is <i>spontaneous fission</i> and it goes on at random,
very much like radioactive decay. It is a relatively rare
process and the fission half-life is long&mdash;about 10 million
aeons (10&sup1;&#8310; years). That means that only about one spontaneous
fission occurs in uranium-238 for every 2 million
alpha decays. That is enough to make a useful clock, however,
because &sup2;&sup3;&#8312;U is present almost everywhere. (See
Table III on <a href="#Page_19">page 19</a>.)</p>
<p>Imagine an atom of &sup2;&sup3;&#8312;U in some mineral. When the atom
suddenly fissions, it breaks in two with considerable energy,
and the two fission fragments rip like cannon balls
through the surrounding crystalline structure in opposite
directions, creating havoc along the way. They travel a
distance something like 10 microns (4 millionths of an inch)
before they are finally slowed down and stopped by all their
collisions with other atoms. Each fragment&rsquo;s path remains
behind as an intensely damaged tube through the crystal.</p>
<p>The process was known for a long time before anyone
was able to find these fission tracks (the damaged tubes) in
the crystals. Finally, about 1960, three young physicists,
R. L. Fleischer, P. B. Price, and R. M. Walker, working at
the General Electric Research Laboratory, fell upon the
idea of etching freshly broken surfaces of crystals with
acid. They reasoned that a region so intensely disturbed by
the passage of a fission fragment should be etched more
easily and deeply than the undisturbed surrounding crystal.
That idea turned out to be correct, and fission tracks have
now been found in almost every common mineral (since
almost all minerals contain small amounts of uranium).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_23">
<img src="images/pgg013.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="331" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Tracks of uranium fission from a fossil antelope bone fragment from Hopefield, Cape Province, South Africa.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The fission clock method works this way: A cleavage
face or a polished surface of a crystal or glass fragment is
etched with a suitable solvent. Different acids work best for
different materials, and a suitable procedure must be developed
especially for each substance. The etching brings
out the fission tracks so they can be seen (usually as little
conical pits) and counted under a microscope.</p>
<p>After this, the sample is exposed to a known amount of
slow neutrons<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> in a nuclear reactor. New fissions are
produced, but this time only in &sup2;&sup3;&#8309;U (which is present in all
natural uranium in the proportion of 1 atom of &sup2;&sup3;&#8309;U to 137.7
atoms of &sup2;&sup3;&#8312;U), because slow neutrons do not produce fissions
in &sup2;&sup3;&#8312;U. After the neutron irradiation, the same surface
is etched again, and the new tracks counted. The old
tracks, having been etched twice, now appear larger and
thus can be distinguished from the new ones that were
caused by &sup2;&sup3;&#8309;U fission.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>The rate at which &sup2;&sup3;&#8312;U decays by fission, &lambda;<sub>f</sub>, is known, as
are the rate it decays by alpha decay, &lambda;<sub>&alpha;</sub>, and the total
number of slow neutrons, <i>n</i>, to which the sample was exposed
in the reactor. The age of the crystal or glass can
then be calculated:</p>
<div class="center">t = <table class="inline"><tr><td class="num">1</td></tr><tr><td class="den">&lambda;<sub>&alpha;</sub></td></tr></table> ln (1 + <table class="inline"><tr><td class="num"><i>n</i>N<sub>s</sub></td></tr><tr><td class="den">N<sub>i</sub></td></tr></table> &times; constant)</div>
<dl class="undent"><dt>where</dt>
<dd>ln = the natural logarithm (log to the base <i>e</i>),</dd>
<dd>N<sub>s</sub> = the number of atoms in the sample.</dd>
<dd>N<sub>i</sub> = the number of atoms of &sup2;&sup3;&#8309;U in the irradiated sample,</dd></dl>
<p>and the constant has the value:</p>
<div class="center">&frac12; <table class="inline"><tr><td class="num">&lambda;<sub>&alpha;</sub>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;582&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10&#8315;&sup2;&#8308;</td></tr><tr><td class="den">&lambda;<sub>f</sub>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;137.7</td></tr></table> = 4.25 &times; 10&#8315;&sup1;&#8312;</div>
<p>Fission-track dating is a brand new technique, still only
partly developed. It has enormous range and is applicable
to numerous minerals; these advantages imply that it is
likely to become very useful.</p>

<h3 id="c9">Plumbology</h3>
<p>The most complicated and therefore probably the most
interesting decay scheme of all is the decay of uranium to
lead, discovered well over half a century ago and still
intensively studied. There are several reasons for the
interest.</p>
<p>First, uranium and lead are geochemically separated to a
high degree, not only on the small scale of an ore deposit
but also on the scale of the earth as a whole. Second,
natural uranium has two isotopes with half-lives that are
neither too long nor too short to be useful (the greater
half-life almost exactly equaling the age of the earth), and
these half-lives differ from each other by a factor of about
6.3. That leads to very important consequences, as we shall
see. Third, uranium and lead are both common, and techniques
are available for extracting them in measurable
quantities from almost any natural material.</p>
<p>As a consequence of these happy circumstances, the
study of uranium and lead has contributed a great deal to
understanding the earth&rsquo;s history and the processes that
go on inside it. F. G. Houtermans, one of the great pioneers
in this study, jokingly called the method <a class="gloss" href="#Plumbology">PLUMBOLOGY</a>,
and it seems a useful name.</p>
<h2 id="c10">THE AGE OF THE EARTH</h2>
<p>The greatest achievement of the &ldquo;plumbologists&rdquo; has
been the calculation of the age of the earth, first proposed
by Houtermans, a German physicist, and independently by
Arthur Holmes, a British geologist, in 1946 and finally
perfected by C. C. Patterson in 1953. It is actually a rather
simple calculation, although the way to discovering it was
far from easy. Before we look at it in detail, however, let&rsquo;s
consider some basic assumptions and explain what is
meant by &ldquo;the age of the earth&rdquo;.</p>
<p>From studying the mechanics of the solar system,
scientists have become reasonably certain that the earth
and the other planets and their satellites all were formed
in a common process in a relatively short period of time,
geologically speaking. Perhaps it took a dozen million
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
years or so, but compared to the time that has elapsed
since, that is a twinkling. At some time soon afterwards,
the earth became molten, or at any rate fluid enough to
allow much of its iron to settle toward the center to form
the earth&rsquo;s core. Similar cores presumably formed in
other planets. As the iron went down, it took some lead
with it, and as the silica went up, uranium followed it
toward the surface, because of the chemical affinity between
these kinds of elements. In the present earth, we
have found, almost all the uranium is concentrated in the
top layer, or crust, which is only about 25 miles thick
under the continents and even thinner under the oceans.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_25">
<img src="images/pgg015.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="431" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Internal structure of the earth. The central core is probably an alloy of iron and nickel, surrounded by a mantle of less dense silicate material, with a thin crust of still lighter silicates.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The time of this early and relatively rapid separation of
uranium and lead on a worldwide scale is the event that
plumbologists can determine, and the period since then is
what they mean by &ldquo;the age of the earth&rdquo;. When Houtermans
first wrote about it, he called it &ldquo;the age of uranium&rdquo;.</p>
<p>How is this done? We have said that one of the isotopes
of uranium, &sup2;&sup3;&#8309;U, decays faster&mdash;about 6.3 times faster&mdash;than
the other, &sup2;&sup3;&#8312;U. They decay into two different isotopes
of lead. Therefore, if we can determine the isotopic composition
of average ordinary lead in the earth&rsquo;s crust
today, and if we can somehow obtain a sample of the kind
of lead that is locked in the earth&rsquo;s core, we can calculate
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
how long it took to change the <a class="gloss" href="#Primordial">PRIMORDIAL</a> lead (like that
in the core) into present-day lead in the crust by the
gradual addition of radiogenic lead&mdash;lead that has resulted
from the decay of uranium. Now, someone might logically
ask, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it necessary to know also the actual amount
of uranium involved in the process, and isn&rsquo;t this difficult
to determine?&rdquo; It turns out to be a remarkable aspect
of the Holmes-Houtermans calculation that the uranium-concentration
terms cancel out in the equations and only
the <i>ratio</i> of the isotopes and their decay constants need be
considered. These are all known accurately.</p>
<p>Next, we must decide just what is average present-day
lead? It isn&rsquo;t enough to go to a lead mine and get a sample,
because, unfortunately, leads from different mines have
widely varied isotopic composition&mdash;that is, a different
mixture of four natural isotopes, &sup2;&#8304;&#8308;Pb, &sup2;&#8304;&#8310;Pb, &sup2;&#8304;&#8311;Pb, and
&sup2;&#8304;&#8312;Pb&mdash;as a result of their geologic histories. No, lead
samples from a mine won&rsquo;t do. However, geologists have
been able to separate lead from recent marine sediments,
obtained from the ocean bottom, far from land. These are
of uniform composition, and are good samples of what the
world&rsquo;s rivers bring into the ocean. Other useful samples
can be found in plateau basalts, which are enormous bodies
of dark volcanic rock that make up the bedrock in many
parts of the world. The lead from these basalts is isotopically
very much like the lead in the oceans.</p>
<p>Very well, but how about the lead from the core? Where
can we hope to find a sample of it? It turns out to be easier
than you might think. Astronomers believe it highly probable
that most meteorites are fragments of a former planet
that broke up for reasons that are not entirely clear. It is
pretty definite, however, that this protoplanet (or these
protoplanets, for there may have been more than one) had
an iron core, and this core (or these cores) is the source
of the iron meteorites sailing around in space. A large
meteorite hit the earth not too long ago (geologically
speaking) and caused the Meteor Crater near Canyon
Diablo in Arizona.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_26">
<img src="images/pgg016.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="429" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Examining ocean-bottom sediments obtained by lowering a tube-like instrument that brings up a long rod-shaped &ldquo;core&rdquo;, prior to nuclear age determination of the sample.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Many fragments of the meteorite iron have been found
around the crater, and it is reasonable to assume that this
is the kind of iron we would expect to find in the core of
the earth. Like the core iron, it is mixed with a little lead,
which can be isolated and analyzed in a mass spectrometer
for its isotopic composition. This lead is found to be much
less contaminated with radiogenic lead, and hence is much
more primitive than the oldest leads found on earth. Thus,
meteorites presumably are as close as we can get to true
primordial lead&mdash;the lead of the time when the earth (and
the protoplanet) first formed.</p>
<p>Once these measurements were available, it was easy to
write the Houtermans equation for present-day and primordial
leads in this way:</p>

<p>Substituting the best experimental lead isotope ratios
into the equation and solving for t, Patterson was able to
calculate that the earth is 4550 million years (4.55 aeons)
old. Subsequent calculations based on other procedures
generally have confirmed that result.</p>

<p>Each method of nuclear age determination involves a
different sequence of sample preparation. Wood, peat,
charcoal, bones, or shells are cleaned for carbon-14

by modern carbon as well as extraneous old
carbon. Rocks are crushed and ground, minerals are
separated according to what is needed in any particular
study, and the desired elements are extracted and separated
by chemical procedures. Often there may be several
different ways of doing the same thing; different laboratories
use different procedures. In every case, however,
long and complicated procedures must be followed before
results are obtained from which an age can be calculated.
There is no such thing as a black box into which you can
throw a rock and read its age on a dial!</p>
<p>Of all the elements that are part of the useful parent-daughter
systems, only potassium is common enough to be
analyzed by conventional chemical techniques. All the
other elements, especially the radiogenic ones, are present
in such small quantities that special processes had to be
developed to measure them. The most valuable and generally
used process is called <a class="gloss" href="#IsotopeDilution">ISOTOPE DILUTION</a>.</p>
<h4>Isotope Dilution</h4>
<p>This is a process for analyzing an unknown material by
incorporating uniformly into it a small amount of a radioactive
test substance and determining how much the tracer
radioactivity is altered by dilution in the original material.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>It works like this: Let&rsquo;s say that we have an unknown
number of atoms, <i>x</i>, of a given element. The normal
isotopic composition of this element is accurately known,
as it is for most elements, and the ratio of two of its
isotopes can be expressed as A/B. We now add to <i>x</i> a
known (but usually smaller) amount, <i>c</i>, of the same element.
This quantity has a drastically different isotopic
ratio, A&prime;/B&prime;. We mix <i>x</i> and <i>c</i> thoroughly together. The
ratio A&prime;/B&prime; can have almost any value, but must be different
from A/B and we must know exactly what it is. (There
are many ways of determining this chemically, or we can
use a sample isotope of known composition obtained from
the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission&rsquo;s Oak Ridge National
Laboratory at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.) The substance added
is known colloquially as the <a class="gloss" href="#Spike">SPIKE</a>.</p>
<p>After the original material and the spike are thoroughly
mixed we have:</p>
<p class="center"><i>x</i>(A/B) + <i>c</i>(A&prime;/B&prime;) = (<i>x</i> + <i>c</i>) (A&Prime;B&Prime;)</p>
<p>in which A&Prime;/B&Prime; will be the ratio of the two isotopes in the
mixture. With this information in hand, we can perform
any chemical purification or transfer process with the
material (see photo on <a href="#Page_22">page 22</a>), without having to worry
about loss. (Even if 90% of the material should be lost in
some operation, the isotopic composition would not be
changed, and that is all we are interested in.) Now we can
place the material containing the isotopic mixture in a
<a class="gloss" href="#MassSpectrometer">MASS SPECTROMETER</a>, which will determine the ratio
A&Prime;/B&Prime;. When we have that, we may substitute the value of
A&Prime;/B&Prime; in the equation and quickly calculate
<i>x</i>, the unknown
concentration of atoms in the original sample.</p>

</div>
<h4>Mass Spectrometry</h4>
<p>The mass spectrometer measures isotopic abundances
using a magnetic field to sort electrically charged particles
into groups according to their masses. It works this
way: A small drop of material to be analyzed is placed on a
metal filament and dried. The filament, in its holder, is
placed inside the mass spectrometer, and heated electrically
in a vacuum, like the filament in a light bulb. As
the wire begins to glow, some of the sample begins to
radiate, or &ldquo;boil off&rdquo;, losing an electron or two in the
process. In other words, some of the atoms will be changed
into positive <a class="gloss" href="#Ion">IONS</a>.</p>
<p>An alternative method is to introduce the sample material
into the vacuum chamber in the form of a gas (like
argon, for example), and then bombard the gas with electrons
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
streaming from a hot filament. The electron stream
will knock some electrons off the gas molecules and this
also will produce positive ions. Either process of ion production
is satisfactory, depending on the problem to be
tackled, but the mass spectrometers for the two methods
are naturally quite different.</p>
<p>Whichever way the ions were produced, they are next
exposed to a strong electric field, accelerated, and electrostatically
focused into a beam. These charged particles
are directed into a magnetic field between the pole faces
of an electromagnet. The magnet does the analyzing by the
principle of magnetic deflection that was known to Andr&eacute;
Ampere and Michael Faraday more than a century ago.
Any moving electric charge has a magnetic field associated
with it. This field interacts with the field of the analyzing
magnet to impress a deflecting force on the charge. The
force acts at right angles to the direction the charge
travels and also at right angles to the direction of the
impressed magnetic field. The pull of this force depends
only on the electric charge and the speed of each particle:
A light single-charged particle will be deflected more than
a heavier particle with the same charge. In this way, the
ions in the beam are sorted out into a number of separate
beams, each made up of particles of the same charge/mass
ratio. Each beam contains one isotope of the original
material, because isotopes differ on the basis of their
mass. By adjusting the current in the electromagnet we
can direct these separate beams into a &ldquo;collector&rdquo; and
electrically measure their intensity one by one. This gives
the relative abundance of the separate isotopes in the
sample.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Minerals That Can Be Dated</h3>
<p>Measuring age by one of the long-lived radioisotopes
requires a closed system. Usually this is some kind of
crystal formed in a period of time that is short, compared
to the time that has elapsed since, and that has remained
unchanged since it formed. Specifically, neither the parent
isotopes can have been added nor the daughter isotopes
removed by any process other than radioactive decay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The earth is a dynamic system, however. Things are
always changing and moving&mdash;not very rapidly, perhaps,
but fast enough, in geologic time, to raise mountains and
shift oceans. Solutions are moving around, dissolving
something here and depositing it again somewhere else.
Temperatures are changing as one place is denuded by
erosion and another area buried under layers of sediment.
Under such conditions, few systems remain closed. It is
perhaps surprising that we find any closed systems at all.
Let us look at a few that are known to be reliable. (They
are listed in Table I on <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>.)</p>
<h4>Potash Feldspar</h4>
<p>In the early 1950s, when the potassium-argon (parent-daughter)
method was being developed by scientists at the
University of Chicago, it was thought that the potash-bearing
variety of the mineral feldspar would be an ideal
closed system, because it was usually optically clear and
free of flaws. This widely shared, logical, and perfectly
scientific deduction soon turned out to be quite wrong.
The scientific workers discovered that when feldspar and
mica from the same rock (and thus of the same age) were
analyzed side by side, the mica always came out older!
Investigation showed that feldspar &ldquo;leaked&rdquo; argon (lost
some of its radiogenic argon) even at room temperature,
but the mica retained all or nearly all of the argon that
had been generated in it.</p>
<h4>Mica</h4>
<p>With the development of the rubidium-strontium (parent-daughter)
method by L. T. Aldrich and his co-workers at
the Carnegie Institution of Washington, came the realization
that mica was also very useful for this analysis, for it
usually contains ample rubidium and not much original
strontium that would mask the presence of the radiogenic
strontium. As a result, mica, especially black mica (the
mineral biotite), has enjoyed great popularity as a good and
easy-to-find closed system.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_29">
<img src="images/pgg019.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="626" />
<p class="caption small"><i>A scientist making adjustments on an &ldquo;argon train&rdquo;, a maze of glass tubing in which argon is released from minerals and purified for analysis.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Everything has its limits, and mica is no exception:
Even mica tends to leak argon at elevated, but still
relatively low (geologically speaking), temperatures. These
effects also depend on pressure and other factors, not all
of which are well known; these elevated temperatures,
pressures and other conditions of course act to some extent
on all rocks buried in the earth&rsquo;s crust. It is known
that at only about 300&deg;C at moderate pressures argon is
leaked from mica faster than it is being generated in it by
the decay of radioactive potassium. The temperature
needed to cause the rapid loss of strontium from mica is
not much higher. Mica, especially biotite, will recrystallize
and lose all its radiogenic constituents (argon and strontium)
at temperatures where many other minerals show
little or no change.</p>
<p>That means that we cannot always rely on mica to give
the date of the <i>original</i> crystallization of a rock&mdash;the time
when it cooled from a molten state. Instead, mica will tell
us when the rock <i>last</i> cooled from, say, several hundred
degrees centigrade, regardless of what may have happened
to the rock before that. The mica may have been reheated
as a result of being buried under a few miles of sediment,
for example. The mica will show when the rock last
cooled&mdash;in other words, when it came up again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h4>Low-Strontium Feldspar</h4>
<p>In spite of early disappointments with potash feldspar for
argon dating, some of it is useful for rubidium-strontium
procedures. It all depends on how much original strontium
the potash feldspar contains. Most feldspars, unfortunately,
contain far too much, but rapid screening by X-ray fluorescence
or flame photometry methods can weed these out
and identify specimens low enough in original strontium to
be useful. Otherwise, feldspar is an excellent closed system
for rubidium and strontium; it remains closed even at
temperatures high enough to melt many other minerals. It
is not affected at all by the same degree of heating that will
drive argon out of biotite. The rubidium-strontium age of
feldspar usually comes close to the time of original
crystallization of the rock.</p>
<p>Obviously, here is a geologically important tool. If we
find feldspar and biotite in one rock, and if feldspar, tested
by the rubidium-strontium method gives the same age as
biotite tested by potassium-argon decay, then we can say
with confidence that the rock has not been reheated since
shortly after it crystallized. Conversely, if the biotite
comes out much younger than the feldspar, we can be sure
that something <i>has</i> happened to this rock long after it first
crystallized. Such information is not only valuable to pure
science&mdash;it can also be useful in locating areas favorable
for ore prospecting and in other practical ways.</p>
<h4>Zircon</h4>
<p>Another very interesting mineral is zircon (a silicate of
zirconium), one of the accessory minerals found in small
quantities in many crystalline rocks. Zircon usually occurs
in very small grains and is heavy and hard, so that it
can be separated from the other rock without much difficulty,
even though it may take 100 pounds of rock to supply
a gram of zircon.</p>
<p>Zircon usually contains a fair amount of uranium and
very little lead. It holds radiogenically produced lead well,
even at relatively high temperatures. But that is not all.
Even if some of the lead is lost, there is a mathematical
way of correcting for it. This technique is called <a class="gloss" href="#ConcordiaAnalysis">CONCORDIA ANALYSIS</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
and was developed by G. W. Wetherill,
a physicist then at the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
It is based, again, on the fact that natural uranium has two
long-lived isotopes&mdash;&sup2;&sup3;&#8312;U and &sup2;&sup3;&#8309;U&mdash;and that the lighter
one, &sup2;&sup3;&#8309;U, decays faster than the heavier. The daughter
products of both uranium decay processes are isotopes of
the same element, lead&mdash;&sup2;&#8304;&#8312;Pb and &sup2;&#8304;&#8311;Pb, respectively.
Heavy isotopes are not separated to any significant degree
by chemical processes, so that if radiogenic lead has been
lost from a system for any reason, the other lead isotopes
also will have been lost in whatever proportion they were
present originally.</p>
<p>If we plot a graph of the radiogenic &sup2;&#8304;&#8310;Pb/&sup2;&sup3;&#8312;U ratio
against the radiogenic &sup2;&#8304;&#8311;Pb/&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;U ratio for concordant
(closed) systems <i>of all ages</i>, we obtain the curved line
shown in the figure below. The curve is the locus of <i>all</i>
concordant U-Pb ages and is called <i>Concordia</i>. Then if
we test two or more particular zircons of the same age
that have lost different amounts of lead, at about the same
time, the plot of their &sup2;&#8304;&#8310;Pb/&sup2;&sup3;&#8312;U
ratios against their &sup2;&#8304;&#8311;Pb/&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;U
ratios will fall on a straight line that is a chord of the
Concordia curve. The upper intersection of this chord with
the curve then will mark the true age of the zircons. This
is an elaborate technique utilizing difficult chemical procedures,
but it has proved invaluable in solving some
important geologic problems.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_30">
<img src="images/pgg020.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="404" />
<p class="caption small"><i>The Concordia curve offers a useful way of analyzing results of age determinations on the mineral zircon.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h4>Hornblende</h4>
<p>The mineral hornblende provides another useful system.
Hornblende is a complex silicate of sodium, calcium, iron,
magnesium, and aluminum, and usually contains a few
tenths of 1% of potassium. It is unusual in that it tenaciously
retains its radiogenic argon, even at relatively high
temperatures.</p>
<h4>Sanidine</h4>
<p>Still another good system is the rare feldspar, sanidine,
which is excellent for both potassium-argon and rubidium-strontium
age determination. Sanidine usually is found in
volcanic ash falls and has been important in the establishment
of the geologic time scale, as we shall see.</p>
<h4>Whole Rocks</h4>
<p>Finally there is still another way of obtaining a closed
system by using the whole rock, not just a crystal of a
single mineral within it. A large body of granite or similar
rock may contain a number of minerals, some or none of
which may be closed systems. Yet as long as this body of
rock remains impermeable to solutions (which in nature
means mostly to water), no substance will be able to move
very far in it because diffusion in solids is so slow. Consequently
it will remain a closed system, as a whole, regardless
of what happens to the individual mineral grains.</p>
<p>If we take a piece from near the middle of this body of
rock and if this piece is much larger than the largest
constituent grain in it, then we have a fair sample of a
closed system&mdash;the whole rock. The only difficulty arises
from the fact that few rocks are sufficiently impermeable
to solutions to retain argon, and many rocks contain so
much common strontium that rubidium-strontium analysis
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
is impractical. Still, we can use the rapid survey methods
as for feldspar, selecting the few rocks that would be
useful. This work has been done frequently, and the results
have been fruitful for rubidium-strontium analysis.
The whole-rock rubidium-strontium age dates the time
when the rock became impermeable.</p>
<h2 id="c13">SOME INTERESTING RESULTS</h2>
<h3 id="c14">The Old Man from Olduvai</h3>
<div class="img" id="pic_31">
<img src="images/pgg021.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="474" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Fossil skull of Zinjanthropus, nearly 2,000,000 years old, discovered in 1959 by Dr. L. S. B. Leakey in Olduvai Gorge. Accurate dating of this earliest human ancestor was possible by using the potassium-argon method.</i></p>
</div>
<p>One of the most talked-about age measurements in
recent years was the determination of the unexpectedly
great age of fossil ancestors of man, found by the British
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
anthropologist, Dr. L. S. B. Leakey, in Olduvai Gorge in
Tanzania. The measurements were made by Garniss H.
Curtis and Jack F. Evernden at the University of California
in Berkeley by the potassium-argon method. The
age came out a little less than 2 million years, about twice
as old as it &ldquo;should be&rdquo; in the view of many scientists.
Human remains of such great antiquity had never been
found before, and much doubt was raised about the validity
of the figures.</p>
<p>Time periods as short as two million years are not easy
to measure by potassium-argon. The amount of argon produced
in that time is extremely small, and contamination
by argon from the air is a serious problem. Still, the
measurements were repeated, the rocks were studied
again, and the result did not change: The fossils were still
about 2 million years old.</p>
<p>In cases like this, one tries to find some other method to
check the results in an independent way. After many attempts
it was discovered that the same rock strata dated
by potassium-argon also contained some pumice&mdash;a porous
volcanic glass&mdash;and that this glass was suitable for uranium
fission-track dating. The measurements were made
in the General Electric Research Laboratory. What was
the result? Just about 2 million years!</p>
<p>When such altogether different techniques give the same
number, one can have some confidence that the number is
exact. It would be difficult to imagine a disturbance in
nature that would cause these unrelated methods to give
the same wrong number&mdash;in both cases by a factor of two.
The double check simply means the Olduvai man is 2 million
years old. There is not much doubt about it.</p>
<h3 id="c15">The Geologic Time Scale</h3>
<p>Much of historical geology is based on a relationship
called the <a class="gloss" href="#LawOfSuperposition">LAW OF SUPERPOSITION</a>. This simply means
that when some rock formation was placed on top of some
other formation by natural processes (sedimentation or
volcanic eruption, for example), the layer on top must be
younger than the one on the bottom. Such a conclusion may
now seem obvious, but the concept was not even expressed
until the very end of the eighteenth century and was still a
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
matter of scientific controversy when Abraham Lincoln
was a boy. It was the law of superposition, however, that
led the early geologists to establish the first geologic time
scales and to realize the enormous extent of geologic time.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_32">
<img src="images/pgg022.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="115" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Diagram illustrating the law of superposition. Each rock bed is younger than the strata under it.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In essence the system of establishing age by this concept
is this: Somewhere a large and easily recognized
layer of sedimentary rock was known. It had a characteristic
color, texture, gross composition, and overall appearance.
Let us call it <i>bed M</i>. This bed could be traced
across the countryside until a place was reached where it
could be seen that <i>bed M</i> rested on another, different layer
of rock, which we might call <i>bed L</i>. <i>Bed L</i> could also be
traced some distance and ultimately could be observed
resting on a still different stratum, which we shall call
<i>bed K</i>. Some of these beds had fossils in them, and it was
eventually realized that rocks with the same kinds of
fossils are of the same age, even though they may differ in
other respects&mdash;in color or composition, for instance.</p>
<p>If <i>bed M</i> was followed in another direction, perhaps a
point was reached where it dipped down a little, and here,
was found still another layer&mdash;call it <i>bed N</i>&mdash;on top of <i>M</i>.
Obviously, the sequence of beds from oldest to youngest
was <i>K-L-M-N</i>. Their relative ages were now established.
Over the years, hundreds of geologists described various
rock layers and identified the fossils in them. By the
middle of the nineteenth century, this &ldquo;layer-cake&rdquo; structure
of sedimentary rocks was well-known in western
Europe. (One may say, parenthetically, that America was
geologically a vast unknown at that time. Today we know
much more about the geology of Antarctica than anyone a
hundred years ago knew about the geology of the United
States.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>A system of nomenclature for the &ldquo;layer-cake&rdquo; was
developed and refined. Gradually this nomenclature was
accepted internationally. Long-range correlations between
beds of the same age, distant halfway around the globe
from each other, were made possible as the science of
<a class="gloss" href="#Paleontology">PALEONTOLOGY</a> developed. The relative age of almost
any rock containing even poorly preserved fossils could
be determined anywhere in the world with precision. That
is, the age of rock layers in relation to one another was
known. But the real age&mdash;the absolute age&mdash;remained
unknown until knowledge of radioactivity provided the
necessary clocks.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_33">
<img src="images/pgg022a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="368" />
<p class="caption small"><i>A geologist carefully maps the layers of soil in which ancient flint tools have been found. Exact correlation of the tool-bearing strata with material datable by carbon-14 analysis must be accomplished before the age of the tools can be determined.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Even this process wasn&rsquo;t entirely without problems.
The difficulty lay in the fact that ordinary sedimentary
rocks (shale, sandstone, and limestone) cannot be dated by
the usual nuclear methods because they present no suitable
closed systems. Only some volcanic sediments can be
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
reliably dated by the mica, feldspar, and zircon they contain;
but these ancient ashfalls are rare, usually are only a
few inches thick, and are not easy to identify at the surface
because they weather quickly to clay. Only about a dozen
volcanic beds have been accurately dated in North America.
The time points they established are mainstays of the
present geologic time scale, but they have had to be
supplemented by indirect information.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_34">

<p class="caption small"><i>Fossils of bird tracks in sandstone in Death Valley, California.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The most important of these indirect time points are
furnished by what geologists call <a class="gloss" href="#BracketedIntrusive">BRACKETED INTRUSIVES</a>.
It often happens in geologic history that a mass of
rock becomes molten at a great depth and forces its way up
through several layers of sedimentary rocks. The sedimentary
layers are usually bent and twisted (folded) by the
upthrust, and where the cooler rock comes in contact with
the molten mass, cooler material is burned (recrystallized).
Geologists call that process <a class="gloss" href="#ContactMetamorphism">CONTACT METAMORPHISM</a>
because the sedimentary rock forms are changed, or metamorphosed,
to have another form or composition. Contact-metamorphosed
rocks, in spite of the damage they have
suffered, may contain recognizable and accurately datable
fossils. Thereby the metamorphic rock establishes a lower
limit for the age of the intrusion: It must be younger than
the fossils in the youngest of the metamorphic rocks it
touched.</p>
<p>Now on top of the intrusive rock, we may find another
sedimentary rock, deposited on top of the intrusive after it
cooled and was exposed by the erosion of overlying materials,
perhaps millions of years later. This new sediment
may also contain fossils and thus furnish an upper limit for
the age of the intrusion. The measured age of the intrusive
rock thus can be used to set upper and lower limits on the
absolute ages of the two sediments. If we are lucky, the
two sediments will bracket a relatively short interval,
making our measurement quite precise.</p>

<p>Using measurements made in many laboratories, and interpolating
between them by using the relative thicknesses
of sediments, the great British geologist, Arthur Holmes,
established the time scale that is in general use today.
His original scale is shown on the preceding page. Small
changes can be expected to be made in this scale from
time to time, but major alterations are not likely, except
perhaps in the Cambrian Epoch where the present data are
unreliable because they are not complete. (A scale showing
the epochs or periods as often given now is on <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="c16">Precambrian Stratigraphy</h3>
<p>So far we have talked only about rocks that are of the
Cambrian Epoch or younger&mdash;rocks that may contain fossils.
Yet there are vast areas (most of Canada, for example)
that are covered with rocks older than the Cambrian
formation. Some Precambrian fossils have been
found, but they are so rare that they are useless for dating
the strata containing them. Long-range correlation of
Precambrian rocks must rely on nuclear measurements.
Therefore it has been only in the last dozen or so years
that some order could be established for the Precambrian
rock sequences. The elaborate Precambrian stratigraphies
(arrangements of strata in sequence) proposed in the past,
most of them based on superficial similarities of the rocks
in one place to those in another place, now have been
drastically altered and in some cases completely overturned
by nuclear measurements. We are still far from
understanding the sequence of all the events in that vast
span of time we call the Precambrian. Many thousands of
nuclear age determinations will have to be made to lighten
the dark corners of our ignorance.</p>

<h2 id="c17">AND WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?</h2>
<p>Perhaps we must first realize that we really haven&rsquo;t
come very far yet. Granted that the age of rocks in many
parts of the world is now suddenly known&mdash;and that this
was a total mystery some dozen years ago. Granted that
enormous strides forward have been made. It&rsquo;s only a
beginning.</p>
<p>Vast areas of the world are still geologically unexplored.
The geologic time scale is still fragmentary and crude.
Thousands of important geologic questions remain to be
defined, explored, and answered by nuclear age determination.
And&mdash;as is inevitable in science&mdash;many of them will
lead to new questions. It is apparent that dating techniques
have barely begun to be used and understood by geologists.</p>
<p>But apart from geologic work, what else is in store? It
is difficult to predict, but probably the most important
advance in the next decade or two will come when we obtain
samples of rock from the moon. Will there be young
rocks there or will they all be 4550 million years old? Or
will they perhaps be some other age? The chemical
composition and nuclear ages of the first moon samples
will probably be the most important information we can
hope to obtain from them. These results from the moon
will contribute enormously to our understanding of the
processes that formed the earth, made the continents, and
determined the major features of our world.</p>
<p>We have a long way to go.</p>

<h2 id="c19">APPENDIX
<br />Radioactive Decay</h2>
<p>When a radioactive nucleus disintegrates or decays, the
resultant remaining nucleus may still be radioactive, and
sooner or later it also will disintegrate and become still
another kind of atom. This process continues through a
series of distinct steps until a stable atom&mdash;one that is
not radioactive&mdash;is formed. All natural radioactivity in the
heavy elements proceeds by such a series of steps, and
the series finally ends with a stable form of lead as its end
product. In other words, any naturally radioactive heavy
element eventually becomes nonradioactive lead.</p>
<p>The nucleus of every atom (except hydrogen) contains
one or more neutrons and one or more protons. The
instability of the nuclei of the heavy atoms is related to the
ratio of the number of neutrons to the number of protons
in the nuclei. Radioactive decay is, in fact, a way of adjusting
these ratios. The adjustment can occur in various ways.
The most common is the emission of alpha particles or
beta particles.</p>
<p>An alpha particle is identical with the nucleus of a
helium atom and has two neutrons and two protons bundled
together. Loss of an alpha particle from a nucleus lowers
the mass number (the total of protons and neutrons) of the
parent nucleus by four and the atomic number (the number
of protons) by two; the number of neutrons also is reduced
by two.</p>
<p>A beta particle is an electron and has a negative electric
charge. When a beta particle is emitted from a nucleus, the
nucleus is changed so that it has one more proton (which
has a positive charge) and one less neutron (which has no
charge); in effect, a neutron has changed into a proton as
the nucleus lost a negative charge. Beta decay occurs in
nuclei with a greater proportion of neutrons than is normal
for the number of protons. Since beta emission increases
the proportion of protons, the process raises the atomic
number of the parent nucleus by one and leaves the mass
number the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Gamma rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation.
They are emitted when a nucleus shifts from one energy
state to a lower energy state&mdash;the energy difference
emerging as the gamma radiation. Gamma emission often
accompanies alpha or beta emission, but the production of
gamma rays does not itself alter the atomic number nor
the mass number of the parent.</p>
<p>Nuclei also can decay by emission of a positron, which is
a positively charged electron. When this occurs, the new
nucleus has one more neutron and one less proton than its
parent; in effect a proton has become a neutron as the
nucleus loses a positive charge. Positrons usually are
emitted by nuclei that have a greater proportion of protons
than is normal for the number of neutrons.</p>
<p>Another process&mdash;internal electron conversion&mdash;sometimes
occurs in connection with gamma-ray emission,
usually in heavy elements when the gamma-ray energy is
low. Instead of being emitted directly, the gamma ray
strikes an orbital electron, knocking the electron out of
the atom; the gamma ray then disappears. Another electron
jumps into the &ldquo;hole&rdquo; in the orbit from which the first
electron was emitted, and this jump&mdash;from a higher to a
lower energy level&mdash;results in the emission of an X ray
(which is similar to a gamma ray, but originates in the
electron orbit region of the atom, not in the nucleus).</p>
<p>Finally, a nucleus may be altered by electron capture.
In a nucleus with a low ratio of neutrons to protons, the
nucleus captures one of its own orbital electrons. This
immediately combines with a proton to form a new neutron
and emit a neutrino (a high-energy particle with neither
mass nor charge). The process increases the neutron-to-proton
ratio of the nucleus; the daughter has the same
mass number as the parent, but has an atomic number one
less than the parent.</p>
<p>There are three series by which naturally radioactive
nuclei decay to stable ones: The Uranium Series, the
Thorium Series, and the Actinium Series. Man-made
radioactive nuclei decay similarly, with bismuth as the end
product, via the Neptunium Series. These can be illustrated
in tabular form and diagrammatically. The Actinium Series
(Uranium-235 Series), for example, proceeds like this:</p>

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_7" href="#fr_7">[7]</a>This decay process proceeds in a series of steps, during which 6 alpha particles and 4 beta particles are emitted. (See <a href="#Page_52">Appendix</a>.)
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_8" href="#fr_8">[8]</a>Named after their creator, John Napier, a Scottish mathematician (1550-1617), who also invented the decimal point.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_9" href="#fr_9">[9]</a>It is difficult to determine the half-life of &sup1;&#8308;C exactly. In the
early days of &sup1;&#8308;C dating, in order not to delay continued work, an
arbitrary value of 5568 years was chosen and this value is still
used in calculations.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_10" href="#fr_10">[10]</a>This means that uranium decays through successive steps in which the entire series emits eight alpha particles. (See <a href="#Page_52">Appendix</a>.)

a moderator (graphite, for example) which is built into every
reactor to accomplish this very thing. For more about how this is
done, see <i>Nuclear Reactors</i> and <i>Research Reactors</i>, companion
booklets in this series.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_16" href="#fr_16">[16]</a>Note that some radionuclides sometimes decay by one method, sometimes by another. For example, 98.8% of the nuclei of actinium-227 emit a beta particle to form thorium-227; the remaining 1.2% emit an alpha particle to form francium-223; both of these daughter products decay to radium-223.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_17" href="#fr_17">[17]</a>Some of the protactinium (0.12%) changes by an intermediate step, known as isomeric transition, in which its nucleus shifts to a lower energy state. The process does not alter the remaining parent-daughter progression in the series.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_18" href="#fr_18">[18]</a>Undergoes both alpha and beta decay, in definite proportion of decay events, as shown.
